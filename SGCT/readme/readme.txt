SGCT - Simple Graphics Cluster Toolkit
===========================================
SGCT is a free static cross-platform C++ library for developing OpenGL applications
that are synchronized across a cluster of image generating computers (IGs).
SGCT is designed to be as simple as possible for the developer and is
well suited for rapid prototyping of immersive virtual reality (VR) applications.
SGCT can also be used to create planetarium/dome content and can generate fisheye projections.
Its also possible to render to file to create extreeme hi-resolution stereoscopic 3D movies.

SGCT supports a variety of stereoscopic formats such as active quad buffered stereoscopy,
passive side-by-side stereoscopy, passive over-and-under stereoscopy,
checkerboard/DLP/pixel interlaced stereoscopy and anaglyphic stereoscopy.
SGCT applications are scalable and use a XML configuration file where all cluster nodes (IGs)
and their properties are specified. Therefore there is no need of recompiling an application for
different VR setups. SGCT does also support running cluster applications on a single computer
for testing purposes.
